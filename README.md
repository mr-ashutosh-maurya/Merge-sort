# Merge Sort in C++

This repository contains an implementation of the **Merge Sort** algorithm in C++, a popular and efficient sorting technique based on the **Divide and Conquer** approach.

## What is Merge Sort?

Merge Sort is a stable and comparison-based sorting algorithm with a time complexity of **O(n log n)**. It divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves back together.

### Key Characteristics
- **Stable Sorting**: Preserves the order of equal elements.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Splits the problem into smaller sub-problems.
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Best: `O(n log n)`
  - Average: `O(n log n)`
  - Worst: `O(n log n)`
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` (requires additional memory for merging).

## Features

- Implementation of Merge Sort in C++.
- Handles arrays of integers and can be adapted for other data types.
- Easy-to-understand code structure suitable for learning and practice.

## File Overview

- **`merge_sort.cpp`**: The main file containing the Merge Sort implementation.
- **`inversion.cpp)`**: This file contain the code of counting no. of inversions.
- **`decreasing-order-merge-sort.cpp)`**:This program reverse sort the array in reverse order.

## How to Run the Program

### Prerequisites
- A working C++ compiler, such as `g++`.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Merge-Sort.git
   cd Merge-Sort
